# üîê Microsoft SC-200 Lab Journal & Study Guide

Welcome! This repository documents my learning journey as I prepare for the Microsoft SC-200: Security Operations Analyst certification exam. I'm combining instructor-led labs, interactive simulations, and personal notes to deepen my skills in detection, response, and threat investigation using Microsoft Learn to explore Sentinel and Microsoft Defender. I'll other spend time on labs from other systems, like Cisco's Networking Academy & TryHackMe.
